# Notebooks
This one contains some Jupyter notebooks. This repo is public because I might want to download these notebooks at other places. Not all of my Jupyter notebooks are on this repo. Some of those are rather private, because of which, I am not uploading those in the first place. I don't actually write anything on Jupyter. All my notebooks are on Visual Studio Code. 

## Reasons
This is because Visual Studio Code is the perfect place for data science now because over there, I get to access .csv files with great ease. These files were made for Microsoft and Visual Studio Code was made by Microsoft. By Microsoft and for Microsoft. I have found the signature colors for data science over there. Some bluish purple with a light theme. Anyways, enough about that. Let's get started.
