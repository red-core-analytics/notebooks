# Notebooks
This one contains some Jupyter notebooks. This repo is public because I might want to download these notebooks at other places. Not all of my Jupyter notebooks are on this repo. Some of those are rather private, because of which, I am not uploading those in the first place. I don't actually write anything on Jupyter. All my notebooks are on Visual Studio Code. 

## Reasons
This is because Visual Studio Code is the perfect place for data science now because over there, I get to access .csv files with great ease. These files were made for Microsoft and Visual Studio Code was made by Microsoft. By Microsoft and for Microsoft. I have found the signature colors for data science over there. Some bluish purple with a light theme. Anyways, enough about that. Let's get started.

## Differences
This repo is fundamentally different from my core analytics notebooks. These are the differences. Now one of these differences actually ends up mentioning seaborn. This is something I have never used. Very soon, I will try it out. This one seems popular as a plot tool. Why am I so excited about seaborn now? It is because I saw it in a Jupyter notebook on Spotify's analysis.
<ol>
  <li>These notebooks are completely in light theme on GitHub. On Visual Studio Code, they are dark.</li>
  <li>The markdowns contain explanations, formal, boring explanations. The real ones are more of gossip.</li>
  <li>The plots here are made through seaborn. The real ones are made of core matplotlib with signature colors.</li>
  <li>A similarity might be the fact that comments exist in the real ones too. Comments aren't preferred on these.</li>
